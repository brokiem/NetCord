> [!NOTE]
> Hosting handles multiple instances of @NetCord.Services.ApplicationCommands.ApplicationCommandService`1 automatically, you don't need to do anything.

To use multiple instances of @NetCord.Services.ApplicationCommands.ApplicationCommandService`1 you need to use @NetCord.Services.ApplicationCommands.ApplicationCommandServiceManager, example:
[!code-cs[Program.cs](MultipleServices/Program.cs)]
